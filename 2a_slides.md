# Introduction

## 

"Why did he die on Tuesday and not on Monday?"  

_~ Douglas Zipes_

## Objectives

Understand how the ventricular substrate is affected by triggers, which are modulated by the autonomic nervous system, leading to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.

## Road Map

1. Ventricular substrate
1. History
1. Story of sudden cardiac death
1. Autonomic modulation
1. Heart rate variability
1. Triggering sudden death

Have this on the handout, include timeline, include references

## 

What do we know about sudden death?

- complication of an MI
- VF arrest goes to the cath lab
- ICDs are placed for low EF

##

::: notes
Describe an acute MI leading to VF
Post-MI the risk is higher for VF, scar

## Ischemia

::: notes
Discuss distal innervation, Zipes work, sympathetic hyperinnervation after infarct
:::

## Differential innervation

::: notes
Bradycardia and vagal tone (cardiac afferents in teh inferior ventricular wall)

## LV size

::: notes
include work about LV size > 4 cm needed

# History

## John MacWilliam

VF proposed as cause of SCD in 1889: 

- fatal syncope
- delirium cordis 
- circus contraction
- intervermiform movement

::: notes
discuss cardiac tetany

## The first defibrillation

Claude Beck performed the first _successful_ human defibrillation in __1947__

::: notes
discuss the fact that 1947 Beck performed first VF defibrillation
This was done a 14 year old boy
45 minutes of cardiac massage (open chest) before countershock

## Precordial thump

## Precipitating death

- Threat, grief, arousal, personal danger, reunion precede sudden death… 8 cases, 1971
- Anxiety/anger precipitated SCD in depressed factory workers… 26 cases, 1972
- Increased stress precedes SCD by several months...226 cases, 1973

::: notes

Anecdotes of events of threat, grief, arousal, mourning, personal danger, reunion precede sudden death.(Engel, 1971)

In an industrial plant in Rochester, NY, there were 26 reported cases of sudden death. Interviews with family noted that these individuals had been depressed over the past several weeks, and the events happened in the setting of acute arousal, either through increased work, anxiety, or anger.(Greene, Goldstein, & Moss, 1972)

Increasing stress has been shown to precede SCD,(Rahe, Bennett, Romo, Siltanen, & Arthur, 1973) and when measured in patients with ICD, VT and VF showed a similar pattern.(Lampert et al., 2002; Peter Taggart, Boyett, Logantha, & Lambiase, 2011)

The events also follow a circadian rhythm. Peak events of MACE occur from 6 AM to 10 AM, followed by a secondary peak of events from 6 PM to 8 PM.(Boudreau, Dumont, Kin, Walker, & Boivin, 2011; Muller, 1999; Portaluppi et al., 2012)

# Story of sudden cardiac death

## Advent of the CCU

Dr. Bernard Lown was an advocate:

- restful rooms
- cardiac monitoring and nurses
- arrhythmia management (chemical and electrical)

Mortality prior >30%, and after <20%

::: notes
has been around since mid 1960s
CCU and bernie lown
70-90% post-MI have ventricular extrasystole
Bernie Lown proposed CCU would reduce mortality after myocardial ischemia
Premises: restful rooms, cardiac monitoring, cardiac nurses, arrhythmia prophylaxis
Reduced mortality >30% to <20%

## Hypotheses behind sudden death

1. Mechanism of SCD is VF
1. Electrical instability precedes catastrophe
1. Ventricular beats predispose the vulnerable heart to VT/VF
1. __Transient nervous risk factors induce electrical instability__

## VF threshold

figure coronary occlusion and VFT

## Changing VFT by hypothalamic stimulation

figure of hypothalamic stimulation leading to changes in VF threshold

# Autonomic modulation

## Neurocardiac axis

drawing neurocardiac axis

::: notes
drawing of the neurocardiac axis
talk about role of ANS on heart, subsequent changes to repolarization and coronary vasomotor tone

Intrinsic cardiac ganglia  
Intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia

## Stellate and vagal stimulation on VFT 

## Stellectomy and vagotomy on VFT

# Heart rate variability

## What is HRV?

The variability in between each beat:

- geometric
- non-linear
- frequency

__The final integration of sympathovagal balance on the SA node.__

## Poincaré plot

## Accentuated antagonism

::: notes
explain that heart rate is also dependent on vagal/sympathetic tone
:::

## Power spectral analysis

::: notes
go over akselrod paper
talk about fourier transformation
