History
=======

1.  VF first proposed as mechanism of sudden cardiac death

    a.  1889 first time that ventricular fibrillation proposed as
        mechanism for SCD (de Silva, 1989)

        i.  prior to advent of ECG

        ii. historically called *fatal syncope*, although still cardiac
            syncope still has significant independent mortality (Koene,
            Adkisson, & Benditt, 2017)

    b.  occurred historically under Carl Ludwig in Leipzig, the home of
        the Ludwig Institute of physiology (training site of Fick,
        Pavlov, Kronecker)

        iii. inventor of kymograph, the first method to record blood
            pressure

        iv. applied electricity to the hearts of mammals inducing
            *cardiac tetany*

    c.  previous names of ventricular fibrillation - delirium cordis,
        circus contraction, intervermiform movement

    d.  First successful defibrillation of the human heart was in 1947
        (Meyer, 1988)

    e.  Ventricular tachycardia, as a pre-fibrillatory rhythm, requires
        low-energy for cardioversion, thus, can be reverted by the
        precordial thump.(Pennington, Taylor, & Lown, 1970)

Model of sudden cardiac death
-----------------------------

1.  Coronary care unit (Lown & Selzer, 1968)

    a.  Bernie Lown proposed that a specialized unit will reduce
        mortality after myocardial ischemia

        i.  70-90% of post-MI have ventricular extrasystole

        ii. Built on the premise of 1) quiet/restful rooms, 2)
            continuous cardiac monitoring, 3) cardiac nurses, 4)
            oriented around prophylaxis of arrhythmias

        iii. Reduction in rate of mortality from \>30% to \<20%

2.  Concept of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation

    b.  Sudden death is an electrical accident that is based on 4
        premises (Lown, Verrier, & Rabinowitz, 1977)

        iv. Mechanism of sudden death is ventricular fibrillation

        v.  Electrical instability of the myocardium may long precede
            onset of catastrophic arrhythmia

        vi. Ventricular premature beats may reflect electrical
            instability, which in turn may predispose the unstable heart
            to develop repetitive ventricular activity and subsequent
            fibrillation

        vii. Transient risk factors induce electrical instability and
            increase cardiac susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation
            (thought from nervous activity)

    c.  The autonomic nervous system, for example, affects/modulates
        risk for ventricular activity. (Lown et al., 1977) Vagal nerve
        activity is protective and increased threshold against
        developing VF.(Kolman, Verrier, & Lown, 1975)

3.  Substrate model (draw out model)

    d.  Ventricular substrate is modified by factors such as ischemia

    e.  Triggers, such as autonomic stimuli, then precipitate VT/VF

Autonomic nervous system
------------------------

1.  Anatomy and neurocardiac axis

    a.  Neurocardiac axis as described by Armour.(Armour, 2010) The
        anatomy is complex, but simplifies down to local ganglion plexus
        in cardiac fat pads (see echo).

        i.  ![Figure 1: Long-axis parasternal view from transthoracic
            echocardiogram. The arrow points to the epicardial fat over
            the free wall of the right ventricle, appearing as the
            echo-free space between the outer layer of the myocardial
            wall and the visceral layer of the
            pericardium](media/image3.jpeg){width="2.2540977690288715in"
            height="1.7071905074365705in"}

        ii. ![](media/image4.png){width="3.5695658355205597in"
            height="2.3980161854768154in"}

    b.  Complex model suggesting directionality of afferent and efferent
        sympathetic markers.(Davis & Natelson, 1993)

        i.  ![](media/image5.png){width="2.5391305774278217in"
            height="3.0303838582677165in"}

2.  Sympathetic tone can lead to increased risk of VF.

    c.  Stimulation of the stellate ganglion in canine models had
        increased chance of causing ventricular fibrillation
        particularly after coronary occlusion.(Harris, Otero, &
        Bocage, 1971)

    d.  Stellate ganglion thought to be carrying efferent sympathetic
        fibers. After stellate ganglionectomy, the VF threshold
        increased to 11% from 31% (compared to control VF rate).(Kliks,
        Burgess, & Abildskov, 1975)

    e.  Effect is complicated however, as unilateral stellectomy may
        have compensatory contralateral activation, and then are
        agonized by vagal activity.(Schwartz, Verrier, & Lown, 1977)

3.  Vagal tone can be protective.

    f.  Vagal influence was not thought to be salutary independently, it
        only provided protection to VF threshold with concurrent
        increased sympathetic tone.(Kolman et al., 1975)

    g.  Vagal nerve asks through muscarinic, nicotinic, and adrenergic
        signals, such as methacholine could raise ventricular vulnerable
        threshold, which could reduced with atropine.(Rabinowitz,
        Verrier, & Lown, 1976)

    h.  Vagal activity is controversial, as sympathetic-independent
        nitrergic parasympathetic postganglionic nerves can
        independently provide ventricular protection and decrease SA-AV
        conduction.(Brack, Coote, & Ng, 2011; Brack, Patel, Coote, & Ng,
        2007; Ng, Brack, & Coote, 2001)

        iii. ![Coote figure on cardiac vagus
            nerve](media/image6.png){width="3.2507075678040245in"
            height="1.8611111111111112in"}

        iv. Multiple types of cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons exist
            in the medulla in feline models, one affected by respiration
            and one that was not.(Daly & Kirkman, 1989)

Heart rate variability
======================

1.  Purpose of HRV

    a.  The multiple factors that influence the cardiovascular system
        include many levels of reflex arches and firing within the
        autonomic nervous system.

    b.  A final integration of dynamic autonomic tone is on the
        sinoatrial node, measured by HRV. This is a summation point for
        multiple levels of control, from environmental, positional,
        contextual elements to volume status, respiration, etc.

        i.  ![http://www.columbia.edu/\~kj3/Figures/Figure4-4.jpg](media/image7.jpeg){width="2.680326990376203in"
            height="2.010246062992126in"}

        ii. ![http://www.columbia.edu/\~kj3/Figures/Figure4-1.jpg](media/image8.jpeg){width="1.719229002624672in"
            height="2.292305336832896in"}

2.  Measurement

    c.  The measurement of HRV is mathematically complex and
        interesting. There are standard, geometric domains, but also
        non-linear and frequency. It is measured in RR or NN intervals
        (beat-to-beat), usually designated as sinus beats. Traditionally
        decreases in time measures, such as the SD of the NN interval,
        suggested worse prognosis.(Kleiger, Miller, Bigger, & Moss,
        1987; Lombardi et al., 1987)

    d.  Non-linear domain is novel, developed over last several
        years.(Tayel & AlSaba, 2015)

        iii. Two PoincarÃ© plots that represent one hour of ECG data at 7
            AM between a twin pair discordant for myocardial stress
            perfusion abnormalities. Each point represents an RR
            interval (ms) on the x-axis plotted against the following RR
            interval (ms) on the y-axis over the course of the
            recording. The first twin (left) was negative for myocardial
            stress perfusion deficits (Dyx = 3.7), and the second twin
            (right) was positive for myocardial perfusion deficits (Dyx
            = 1.7).

        iv. ![/var/folders/c5/zg7f9fms09s7238gs\_x5qq0m0000gn/T/com.microsoft.Word/WebArchiveCopyPasteTempFiles/p2405](media/image9.jpeg){width="3.7958737970253718in"
            height="2.0901640419947505in"}

    e.  Frequency domain measures are an attempt to study HRV in terms
        of physiological correlates, through power spectral
        analysis.(Akselrod et al., 1981) By using a Fourier transform,
        the series of RR intervals are decomposed and broken into bands,
        each corresponding to a physiological measure. HF occurs at
        \~0.4 Hz, which corresponds to respiratory rate.

        v.  ![](media/image10.png){width="2.5491797900262467in"
            height="1.410764435695538in"}

        vi. ![](media/image11.png){width="2.434425853018373in"
            height="1.7033180227471567in"}

        vii. Very low frequency (VLF) is between 0.0033 and \< 0.04 Hz;
            low frequency (LF) is between 0.04 and \< 0.15 Hz; and high
            frequency (HF) is between 0.15 and \< 0.40 Hz. These
            frequency bands integrate heart rate in response to
            physiologic stimuli, including influences of the
            renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (VLF), baroreceptor
            activity (LF), and respiration (HF).

3.  Responsiveness of vagal and sympathetic tone

    f.  Measure the different components is quite useful, particularly
        in teasing apart the effects. This study uses a conscious canine
        model to demonstrate an important, summative concept of
        *accentuated antagonism*.(Stramba-Badiale et al., 1991) Each dog
        has had a vagal nerve stimulator implanted in the cervical
        region, and subsequently had this activated during exercise
        versus at rest. 1) Immediately there is a change in heart rate
        with stimulation, suggesting that vagal activity is very rapid
        in its effect, almost instantaneous. 2) The effect was
        over-proportional to the amount of sympathetic tone (e.g. at
        higher heart rates, a larger bradycardic response occurred).

        viii. ![](media/image12.png){width="2.5in"
            height="1.7395833333333333in"}

    g.  The vagus and sympathetic system thus must communicate and
        interact, potentially at multiple levels.

4.  Review of HRV and ANS

    h.  HRV is final integration of ANS on the heart

    i.  Vagal tone is sudden, sympathetic is slow

    j.  Altered or low HRV tends to suggest poor prognosis, and may even
        be predictive.

Ventricular substrate
---------------------

1.  Differential innervation of the heart

    a.  The inferior wall of the left ventricle has a higher proportion
        of vagal afferent neurons, such that inferior ischemia, usually
        from the RCA system, leads to a cardioinhibitory pattern and
        subsequent sinus bradycardia.(Walker, Thames, Abboud, Mark, &
        Kloppenstein, 1978)

    b.  In humans, imaging shows a consistent pattern of increased vagal
        innervation of the inferior wall, based on MIBG uptake in the
        myocardium.(Morozumi et al., 1997)

2.  Ventricular size

    c.  Historically, \>4 cm of ventricle was needed to sustain VF.(de
        Silva, 1989) This is consistent with current research that shows
        a higher left ventricular volume/mass increases susceptibility
        to VF.(Aras, Faye, Cathey, & Efimov, 2018; Shenasa &
        Shenasa, 2017)

    d.  LVIDD increases the risk of SCD independently of reduced
        EF.(Narayanan et al., 2014)

        i.  ![](media/image13.png){width="2.2445680227471567in"
            height="1.7635214348206474in"}

3.  Ischemia

    e.  The depth of ischemia is important. Transmural infraction leads
        to sympathetic denervation, unlike subendocardial ischemia,
        which may only damage vagal efferent nerves (as seen in
        figure).(Herre et al., 1988; Zipes, 1990)

        ii. ![](media/image14.png){width="1.9992508748906386in"
            height="1.7230774278215224in"}

    f.  Response to ischemia can be both denervation as well as
        hyperinnervation, which leads to tissue that has heterogenous
        sympathetic fibers, leading to arrhythmogenesis.(Huang, Boyle, &
        Vaseghi, 2017) The location of ischemia is also important, as
        measuring postganglionic activity shows differences in activity
        depending on whether it serves ischemic versus nonischemic
        territory.(Neely & Hageman, 1990)

4.  Review substrate model

    g.  Simplified model suggesting how ANS affects cardiac
        refractoriness and repolarization.(P Taggart, Critchley, &
        Lambiase, 2011)

        iii. ![](media/image15.png){width="2.5391305774278217in"
            height="3.21208552055993in"}

Triggering sudden death
-----------------------

1.  Precipitating events

    a.  Anecdotes of events of threat, grief, arousal, mourning,
        personal danger, reunion precede sudden death.(Engel, 1971)

        i.  After the Northridge earthquake in 1994, there was an
            increase in number of SCD, even after accounting for trauma
            or physical exertion.(Leor, Poole, & Kloner, 1996)

            1.  ![](media/image16.png){width="3.2538462379702535in"
                height="1.8181211723534558in"}

        ii. In an industrial plant in Rochester, NY, there were 26
            reported cases of sudden death. Interviews with family noted
            that these individuals had been depressed over the past
            several weeks, and the events happened in the setting of
            acute arousal, either through increased work, anxiety, or
            anger.(Greene, Goldstein, & Moss, 1972)

        iii. Increasing stress has been shown to precede SCD,(Rahe,
            Bennett, Romo, Siltanen, & Arthur, 1973) and when measured
            in patients with ICD, VT and VF showed a similar
            pattern.(Lampert et al., 2002; Peter Taggart, Boyett,
            Logantha, & Lambiase, 2011)

    b.  The events also follow a circadian rhythm. Peak events of MACE
        occur from 6 AM to 10 AM, followed by a secondary peak of events
        from 6 PM to 8 PM.(Boudreau, Dumont, Kin, Walker, & Boivin,
        2011; Muller, 1999; Portaluppi et al., 2012)

    c.  Increasing the frequency of VT and VF after induction of
        stressful situations.(Lown, Verrier, & Corbalan, 1973; Lown et
        al., 1977; Verrier, Calvert, & Lown, 1975)

        iv. ![](media/image17.png){width="2.161185476815398in"
            height="1.7557327209098863in"}

        v.  ![](media/image18.png){width="2.707692475940507in"
            height="1.6168044619422572in"}

        vi. ![](media/image19.png){width="1.9378740157480314in"
            height="1.3654155730533684in"}

2.  Autonomic risk

    d.  In canine model, those at risk for VF after stress/coronary
        occlusion had decreased HRV during testing, suggesting an
        independent/additional risk factor.(Houle & Billman, 1999)

        vii. ![](media/image20.png){width="2.9016393263342084in"
            height="1.959536307961505in"}

    e.  Increased mortality with autonomic dysfunction seen in multiple
        studies.(Bauer, 2017; De Ferrari et al., 2007; JÃ¸rgensen et al.,
        2016; La Rovere, Bigger, Marcus, Mortara, & Schwartz, 1998)

        viii. ![](media/image21.png){width="1.9625076552930885in"
            height="1.9461537620297462in"}

    f.  Potential explanation of autonomic risk is microvascular
        ischemia, changes in resistance vessels, although its not
        certain if epicardial vessels could be obstructed either.
